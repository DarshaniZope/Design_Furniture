        <h3 class="about grid_12">About Us</h3>

        <p class="content grid_12">In 2012, we started Design Furniture with a vision - to make a million homes beautiful.
        Back then, our catalogue featured just 35 designs. Yet, when our customers shared
        photographs of their homes, we saw they were remarkably distinct. The same table, the
        chair was used differently by different people. This told us something. People
        want their homes to be unique. We also realized that people are a lot happier creating
        things than they are buying things. We are a creative, imaginative, expressive species.
        And our homes are just one of the many canvases we have at our disposal.<br>

        Today, we understand that we’re here not just to sell well-designed products. We’re
        here to help you create spaces that mirror who you are. At Design Furniture, we want you
        to discover the joy of creating. Starting with your home. We want you to think of the
        setting up of a space as an energizing, creative pursuit. To breathe life into empty
        rooms with your ideas. To take a few square feet of nothing, and transform it into
        something beautiful.<br></p>

        challenges and get better solutions.</p>
